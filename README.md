# Exploratory Data analysis projects

Data analysis is a vast field with innumerable real-world applications. In this project the aim is to select a dataset and analyze the data which is useful to gain an insight about the dataset.

1.  Some Data visualization techniques were applied and inferences about the dataset were drawn.

2.  predictive models were built using some standard machine learning algorithms and their accuracies compared.

3.  Performed indepth Exploratory data analysis of these datasets found on Kaggle and drew insights from it.

4.  Tried answering some problems and suggested some solutions to it.
   
5.  Made some visualizations for better understanding.

If you are unable to see some visualizations open these noteboks in Google colab.
